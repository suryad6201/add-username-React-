# add-username-React-

You can view the live demo here: https://add-username-project.netlify.app/

Simple adding username mechanism using React. I've got hands on practice on:
- React components
- React fragments
- Events
- useState
- useState uplift
- React CSS Styling
- Linter

Note: Run "npm install" in your terminal to install modules and run the code. 

Thanks for viewing my project.
